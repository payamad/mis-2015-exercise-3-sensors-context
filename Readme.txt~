According to sensor overview page in developer.google.com, when the device is not moving, for
instance when we are sitting,the average is about 9.81. In addition, by testing the software
and watching the results, We found out the average for walking is around 10 to 15. Finally,
we considered average values above 15 as a running situation.

The problem is by considering a big value for FFT window or minimizing the sample rate,
activity recognition will not work very well. We experienced that if we consider 64 for FFT
window and 200000 for sample rate, we will face the best results.
